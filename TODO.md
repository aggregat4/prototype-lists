# TODO


- Moving tasks between lists using drag and drop no longer works. this did use to work right? Add E2E test?
- Understand the new flushing thing in the index.html
- when searching across lists, don't show the Add button (do we need to show the show Done checkbox? Takes place but useful?)

- find out if there are any GUI affordances we can make to inline editable things to make it clearer for the user (show list rename with a floating pencil icon or something)
- Keep the sliding button caret to the right of the buttons when expanding it: this is less surprising and more stable and prevents accidental delete activations
