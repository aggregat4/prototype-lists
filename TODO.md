# TODO

- add a button for delete like for move
- then consider where to move these actions: perhaps add something like a tab to each item that you can click on and trigger a menu with Move and Delete in it?
- have more sensible names for custom properties (more descriptive)
- find out if there are any GUI affordances we can make to inline editable things to make it clearer for the user
