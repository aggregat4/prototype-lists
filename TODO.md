# TODO

- [ ] add ability to delete (press backspace on empty content and what kind of other interaction? brainstorm with AI)
- [ ] add ability to hide completed items (toggle button and keyboard shortcut)
- [ ] make tasklist action bar go into two lines when horizontal screen size too small (header on one line and buttons on next)
