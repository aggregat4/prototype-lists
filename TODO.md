# TODO

- We now have some passing E2E tests, and can run them in codex. Let it fix the remaining issues and figure out whow we can allow permissions permanently to run them
- find out if there are any GUI affordances we can make to inline editable things to make it clearer for the user (show list rename with a floating pencil icon or something)
- Keep the sliding button caret to the right of the buttons when expanding it: this is less surprising and more stable and prevents accidental delete activations
